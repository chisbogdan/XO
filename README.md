# XO
Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.
Variable names are written in Romanian.
It's a player vs AI game.
When the game starts it's the human player's turn.
At the end of the match a green rectangle appears in the window, which is a rematch button.
If you press the rematch button a new grid replaces the old one and the game goes on.
If the human player makes the last move (doesn't matter if the result is a win or tie) when the next round stars it's the AI's turn.
When the AI starts the match it takes a bit of time to make the first move (depending on the computing power of the PC).
